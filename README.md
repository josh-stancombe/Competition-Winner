## Description:
- I was asked by a local business to create a webpage which would generate a competition winner. The page was to be simplistic, easy to use and feature a large-scale company banner. 

- To use, the user must type the names of the competition entrants into the 'Name Entries' input and click 'Generate Winner'. 
  
- The project consists of one HTML file featuring internal CSS styles (CSS) and JavaScript, along with one logo banner image.

## Upcoming Features:
- The next release version will feature a 'remove' name button, in the event that a name is mispelled or added incorrectly.
